Module "Temp"      (component ADC)
   - Temp_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - Temp_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - Temp_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

Module "RTC1"      (component RTC_LDD)
   - RTC1_Init -Initializes the device. There are two modes of initialization.   1) RTC device is NOT battery backed up. 
                (SoftInit = FALSE)     All registers (interrupts, counters, clock routing …) that influence RTC behavior are 
                initialized.      Note: This initialization mode doesn't preserve time and date settings.   2) RTC device IS 
                battery backed up.     (SoftInit = TRUE). Only registers that are not backed up are initialized (Interrupt 
                priority …). RTC device is running, time and date a preserved, RTC interrupts (events) are preserved too.   
                Allocates memory for the device data structure.   This method can be called only once. Before the second call 
                of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - RTC1_GetTime -Returns actual time and date.    Note: Fields not supported by HW are calculated in software.
   - RTC1_SetTime -Sets new time and date.   Note: All LDD_RTC_TTime structure members must be correctly filled in.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
